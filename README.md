# Project 02 : Digital Translation

## Deliverables

### Week 07 - Milestone 01
**Write a one-paragraph idea for your visual collection**

For this project, I would like to expand on our week 01 assignment, where we choose 10 artefacts and sketched out different ways on how to present them. I chose magnets as the theme for my 10 artefacts. They were collected from places I have travelled to.

The categories on how I would like to group them are as follows:
- **Continent:** North America, Europe, Oceania, Asia
- **Material:** Metal, Wood, Ceramic, Vinyl

If possible, the magnets can also be sorted by
- **Alphabetical order:** (A-Z, Z-A)
- **Chronologically:** (Earliest-oldest, Oldest-earliest)

Link to the magnets can be found [**here**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15-jNCUc9K8didKvfGxyD4LemqsY42Qd3?usp=sharing).

## Brief
In this project, you will create a visual collection of related items, considering how they are categorized, described, and contextualized in a digital space. Your collection can focus on anything, but should be structured with intentional metadata and organizational logic. It may be as practical or impractical as youâ€™d like. It may be esoteric, speculative, historical, or personal. What matters is that you have a clear justification for your method.

The goal is to think critically about curation, classification, and the relationships between different elements. How do digital collections shape meaning? What does metadata reveal or obscure? Additionally, this is an opportunity to put your JavaScript learnings into practice.

## Assignment Goals
- Curate a collection of at least 10-15 items with categories and metadata.
- Explore how classification systems impact interpretation.
- Structure the collection using JSON for data organization.
- Build a simple front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the collection.
- Provide an index and filtering interface (search is optional).

### Final Deliverables
**Due Week 10, Apr 3rd**
- **Final Visual Collection:** A front-end interface with a collection of at least 10-15 items, including categories and other metadata, that can be viewed and filtered in different ways.
- **Reflection Paper (500+ words):** Think about: Why this collection? How did you make decisions regarding what to include and what not to include? How does structuring and classifying the collection affect interpretation? How did you make your design decisions and how do these affect the process of navigation and discovery? How does the inclusion of JavaScript affect the digital experience?
